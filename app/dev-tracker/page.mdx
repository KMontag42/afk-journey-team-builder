## Known Bugs

These are bugs that have been reported, and we know about.
Consider this section our first priority!

These are also good places to get started if you want to [contribute](https://github.com/kmontag42/afk-journey-team-builder)

1. Searching for two word heroes doesn't work right (laundrymat, pontilicious)
1. Race condition when creating / updating formations (laundrymat)

## Soon

These are smaller projects that can be
knocked out quickly and give us some easy wins.

Be on the lookout for these features to ship sooner rather than later!

1. [Grug](https://grugbrain.dev/) tags (KRM)
1. Multiple faction tiles per formations (Metal369)
1. View liked formations (victortron)
1. Show like count on formations (pontilicious)
1. Toggle tile numbers (Metal369)
1. Formation builder filter design updates (cam, Eltrius)
1. Reset formation button (laundrymat)
1. Talent builder (liam)

## Later

These features require some more complex work,
or potentially more planning by the team.

If you are interested in seeing one of these features get released soon,
reach out to KRM on discord.

1. Charm selector
1. User generated map layouts
1. Roster builder
1. My formations list view + bulk delete (Endgame)
1. Formation description / notes (laundrymat)

## Backburner

These are ideas we have had, but haven't really started planning or working on.

We feel they are good ideas, but need to let them cook more.

1. Formation lookup while building (Naiddean)
1. Clashfronts planner
1. Guild system
1. Battle Drill planner
