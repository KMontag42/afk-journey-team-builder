### Updating Data in the CMS

Go to [simplejsoncms](https://simplejsoncms.com/mdb18slfe7).

Update data using their editor, recommended method is to copy paste the contents of a file into the text editor.

Input the password. If you don't have it, reach out to `0xKRM` on discord and we can talk.

Hit save.

The `lib/cms-export.json` file is not mandatory to update, but it helps to have.

Be sure to pull in the data from the CMS into this file before making any edits.
